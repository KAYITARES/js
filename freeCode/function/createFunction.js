In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into 
reusable parts called functions.

function functionName() {

/*
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed
 by parentheses, like this: functionName(); 
 Each time the function is called it will print out the message
  Hello World on the dev console. 
  All of the code between the curly braces will be executed 
  every time the function is called.
